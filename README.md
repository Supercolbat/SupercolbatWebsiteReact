### Hi there, I'm Joey (Supercolbat)!

I am a high school student who likes to develop. I have experience with writing Discord bots, web scraping and automation, mobile app development, and a few other things.

I consider myself as a Pythonista, but I can also use the following languages or frameworks.

- Javascript
- HTML (Pug) and CSS (Sass)
- Flutter/Dart
- L-l-lua...
- Brainfork
- Discord.py
- /r(e)g\1x/i

I'm also (planning on) learning these languages and frameworks:

- Rust :crab:
- uh idk
